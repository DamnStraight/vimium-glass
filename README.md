# Vimium Glass
An Omnibar theme for the Vimium C extension, not tested on regular Vimium. To install just copy the contents of the CSS file into the "Custom CSS" section in the Vimium C settings.

Styled after Raycast, light theme was implemented as an afterthought because I never plan on using it.

Credit to [Vimium Snow](https://github.com/dermoumi/vimium-snow) as I used it as a base.
